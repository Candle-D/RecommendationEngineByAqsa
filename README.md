# RecommendationEngine
This project demonstrates the working of K-nearest neighbor search algorithm for creating a recommendation engine under guidance of mentor during MICROSOFT ENAGAGE'22 program.

The project has been divided into two parts.

1. K nearest neighbors : Calculates the K most similar users to a user chosen from my dataset present in the json file.One check the accuracy of the application with help of console which prints the objects and their ratings and can compare the ratings.

2. Predicting Rating : The foundation of a recommendation engine is prediction. So my project does predict ratings for unseen movies for a new user based on his/her ratings for some of the watched movies.
